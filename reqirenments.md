- ollama
    - Ollama is an open-source tool that allows you to easily download, run, and manage large language models (LLMs) directly on your local machine (like your laptop or a local server).
- gradio
    - open-source Python library that allows developers to quickly build and share interactive web interfaces
- pdfplumber
    - is a Python tool for extracting text, tables, images, and layout details from PDFs with high accuracy. It supports region-based cropping and works well with data tools like pandas.
- langchain
    - an open-source framework that helps developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) by providing tools to connect LLMs to external data and enabling the creation of complex workflows
        - langchain-core
        - langchain-ollama
        - langchain_community
            - Executing pip install langchain-community pulls the core library plus a large set of pre-built connectors—vector stores (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate), model wrappers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face), document loaders (PDF, SQL, cloud buckets), and tracing utilities
        - langchain_text_splitters
- unstructured
    - a company and open-source project that provides a platform for processing and transforming unstructured data into a clean, structured format, making it usable for AI applications like Large Language Models (LLMs). It handles a wide variety of file types, such as PDFs, Word documents, and emails, and can convert them into a structured JSON format with elements like titles, lists, and tables. 
        - unstructured_[all-docs]
- onnx==1.17.0
    - Open Neural Network Exchange. It's an open-source format for AI models, defining an extensible computation graph model, built-in operators, and standard data types . The goal is to allow AI developers to move models easily between different deep learning frameworks (like PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) and various inference runtimes.
- protobuf==3.20.3
    - Protocol Buffers, or Protobuf for short, is Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It is a highly efficient, compact, and strongly-typed alternative to data formats like JSON or XML, designed specifically for high-performance data exchange, especially between servers in a microservices architecture
- chromadb==0.4.22
    - Chroma is an open-source vector database specifically designed for building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), like those used for semantic search, retrieval, and question-answering
    - Database Type: ChromaDB
    - Key Strength: Ease of use, open-source, tight LLM integration, rapid prototyping.	
    - Best For: Small to medium-sized RAG and semantic search applications.
	
    - Database Type: Traditional DBs (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
    - Key Strength: Combining vectors with existing relational data in one place.
    - Best For: Projects that already use PostgreSQL and don't require extreme vector scaling.
- Pillow
    - Pillow is a powerful, open-source library that adds image processing and graphics capabilities to the Python programming language.
